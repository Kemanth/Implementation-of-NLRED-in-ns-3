# Extending RED qdisc in ns-3 to support Non-Linear RED (NLRED) algorithm.
Course Code: CS822  <br/>
                    <br/>
Assignment: #GP1    <br/>

Overview:           <br/>

Non-Linear RED is an Active Queue Management [1] mechanism which is a variant of Random Early Detection (RED) [2]. This repository contains an extention to the RED that is implemented in ns-3 [3]. <br/>
